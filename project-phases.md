## Introduction

<a name="phase-1"></a>
## Phase 1 
The aim of phase one is to create an API which is easier to consume and manipulate as the current M2 API.
External Systems like CMS, PIM and others can use the API. During the development process the existing Magento 2
API can be used for unfinished Laragento-endpoints.
